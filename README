This C# application creates visualizations of FASTA formatted DNA nucleotide data. 
DDV can download FASTA sequences from NIH, or use local FASTA formatted files. 
DDV generates a DeepZoomImage visualizations of DNA data.

Demonstration:

Visualizations generated with DDV can be placed on a web server. 
The following contains the links to examples of the visualizations 
generated by Tomasz Neugebauer, Éric Bordeleau, Vincent Burrus and Ryszard Brzezinski 
with this software: DNA Data Visualizations Generated with DDV Software.
